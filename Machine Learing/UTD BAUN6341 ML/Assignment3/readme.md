Buan6341 - Machine Learning 

4 code files: 
`Assignment3 - ANN Mobile Price Data.ipynb`
`Assignment3 - KNN Mobile Price Data.ipynb`
`Assignment3 - ANN Online News Popularity Data.ipynb`
`Assignment3 - KNN Online News Popularity Data.ipynb`

The codes are similar the main difference between these two files is data and the data preprocessing.
Package used: Sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow

Run the code in order to make sure all the functions are defined before use.
Workflow:
1. Import Data
2. Normalize Data
3. Split data into `train` and `test`
4. Error Rate detection
5. Performance Comparisons
