Buan6341 - Machine Learning 

2 code files: `Assignment2 - Mobile Price Data.ipynb` and `Assignment2 - Online News Popularity Data.ipynb`. The codes are similar the main difference between these two files is data and the data preprocessing.
Package used: Sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Run the code in order to make sure all the functions are defined before use.
Workflow:
1. Import Data
2. Normalize Data
3. Split data into `train` and `test`
4. Feature Selection (only in Online News code file)
5. Error Rate detection
6. Performance Comparisons
7. Comparisons of the three learning algorithm
